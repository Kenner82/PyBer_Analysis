# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, 2 .csv files with ride-sharing data were merged and analyzed. A summary DataFrame was used to calculate and display the Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver for each type of city (urban, suburban, and rural). A multi-line graph was then created to display the total fares by city type each week from 1/1/2019 through 4/28/2019.

## Results
The summary DataFrame shows that the number of total rides and total drivers in each city type increases as the population density increases from rural to suburban to urban. The total fares increases in the same way, but breaking down the average fare per ride and per driver shows an inverse relationship - the totals may be higher, but the amount earned per ride or driver is lower the most densely populated a city type is.
